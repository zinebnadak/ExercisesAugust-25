#3 Suppose a ball is dropped onto a floor and with each bounce it loses 30% of its height. Write a program that calculates how many times such a ball bounces before it comes to rest. (By “comes to rest,” we mean that it no longer bounces higher than 1 cm.) As input, the program should let the user specify the height, measured in meters, from which the ball is dropped.
height = float(input("Enter the height the ball is dropped from (in meters): "))
original_height = height # save the starting height so that When you run your code, you’re not printing height at the end
bounces = 0

while height >= 0.01:
    height = height * 0.70
    bounces = bounces + 1

print(f"If you drop a ball from {original_height} it will bounce {bounces} times before stopping!")


#4 Write a program that lets you choose your goal, and by entering your daily salary lets you know how many days it will take you to surpass you goal
salary = float (input("Enter your daily salary: "))

total_money_so_far = salary

years=current_day // 365
days=current_day % 365

#5 Write a program that lets the user specify a multiplication table and then prints it out. Use a while loop.

table = int(input("Enter desired multiplication table: "))

variable = 1
answer = table

while variable>table:
    answer=variable*table
    variable=variable+1

    print (f"{variable}*{table}={answer}")

#6 Write a program that lets the user specify a multiplication table and then prints it out. Use a while loop.

table = int(input("Enter desired multiplication table: "))
variable = 0
while variable <= table:
    while variable < 9:
        variable = variable + 1

#7 Suppose that the grade in a course is determined by a number of assignments. The maximum score on each assignment is 10 points. If, for example, there are 4 assignments, each assignment will contribute 25% of the total grade. Write a program that lets the user enter scores for a student and then calculates the total percentage. Use a while loop to read the scores from the assignments. The loop should update a variable that contains the sum of the scores entered so far. The program should allow the user to enter scores until the letter ‘a’ is entered. We assume that the user only enters numerical values between 0–10, and ‘a’.
print ("Enter points for student, end with \"a\": ")

Assignment = 1          #first Assignment number
points = 0              #No input from user yet

points = input(f"Assignment {Assignment}: ")            #read input as a string

while points != "a":
    points = int(points)                #covert safely to integer to do calculations ,only if input is not "a"
    Total_points = Total_points + points

    Assignment = Assignment +1
    points = input(f"Assignment {Assignment}: ")

Max_ponits = (Assignment-1)*10
Score_percentage = (Total_points/Max_ponits)*100

print()
print (f"Totalpoints: {Total_points}/{Max_ponits} or {Score_percentage}% ")

#for more efficient code use while True and break statement
print ("Enter points for student, end with \"a\": ")
Assignment = 1
Total_points = 0

while True:
    points = input(f"Assignment {Assignment}: ")           #will ask this to user forever

    Total_points = Total_points + points                   #updated counter to users input

Max_ponits = (Assignment-1)*10                             #Assignment-1 to not count with assignment when user enters "a",  each assignment max 10 points.
Score_percentage = (Total_points/Max_ponits)*100           #score in percentage

print()
print (f"Totalpoints: {Total_points}/{Max_ponits} or {Score_percentage:.0f}% ")      #result printed in end

#8 Write a program that prints the first five multiplication tables (1×1 up to 10×5). Use a nested while loop.
table = 1  # start from table 1
result = 0

while table <= 5:  # controls table
    variable = 0  # reset variable for each table

    while variable <= 9:  # controls variable
        variable = variable + 1
        result = variable * table
        print(f"{variable} * {table} = {result}")
    print()  # blank line after each table
    table = table + 1       #By placing table = table + 1 after the inner loop, the outer loop will: Start with table = 1, Run the inner loop for table = 1, Then increment → table = 2.
