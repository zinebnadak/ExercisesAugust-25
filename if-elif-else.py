#3 In a gym you can either buy a year-card or a one-time-ticket. Write a program that reads the price for a year-card, prie for a one-time-tic and the amount of times one intend to train under one year. The program will tell you if it is worth buying a year-card or not

#4 Leap years are years that are evenly divisable by 4, with the exception of those that are evenly divisable by 100. However those years that are evenly divisable by 400 are leap years. Write a program that lets user input a year and prints if it is a leap year or not:

#6 The traditional assumption that seven human years correspond to one dog year is a simplification of reality. A more realistic estimate for a medium-sized dog is:
#first dog year = 15 human years
#second dog year = 9 human years
#each subsequent dog year = 5 human years

#7 # A mobile operator offers three different subscriptions: Basic, Normal, and Plus. When comparing the conditions for the subscriptions, it turns out that the subscription Kontant is cheapest if you call at most 33 minutes per month, Normal is most profitable if you call between 33 and 66 minutes per month, and Plus is most advantageous if you call even more.

#8 (and/or/not) Write a program that asks the user two yes/no questions:
#Is the traffic light green? (yes / no)
#Is there a pedestrian crossing? (yes / no)

#Your program should decide whether the car can GO or must STOP based on these rules:
#If the light is green and there is no pedestrian, print "You can go!"

#10 (Using Pass-command) Password Strength Checker
# Write a program that asks the user for a password.
# Your program should:
# If the password length is less than 6 → just use pass "Password is weak"
# If the password length is between 6 and 10 → print (don’t print anything )..
# If the password length is more than 10 → print "Password is strong".
# Then add a line that prints: "Good password, Please remeber your password or write it down!"
